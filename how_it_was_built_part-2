Add gem bcrypt to Gemfile
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/8777bb6b0af740d44b81430c685e50e888b52bac

bundle install

bundle exec rspec
    - User model specs pass at this point

bundle install

Add the lib directory & create the jwt class file
    mkdir app/lib
    touch app/lib/json_web_token.rb
    - As of rails 5 autoloading is disabled in production for thread safety
    - The JWT class should live in eat-in/lib since it's not domain specific
    - Since eat-in/lib is part of the autoload path, positioning the JWT class
    in eat-in/lib may raise an issue with autoloading disabled
    - The solution is to create 'lib' directory in eat-in/app
    - eat/app is autoload in development and eagerloaded in production

Define the JsonWebToken class

Add custom errors handlers JWT errors
    - Defining the custom errors as sub-classes of StandardError
    enables us to rescue_from the custom errors once the errors are raised
