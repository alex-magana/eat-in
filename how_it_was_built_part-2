bundle install

Add the lib directory & create the jwt class file
    mkdir app/lib
    touch app/lib/json_web_token.rb
    - As of rails 5 autoloading is disabled in production for thread safety
    - The JWT class should live in eat-in/lib since it's not domain specific
    - Since eat-in/lib is part of the autoload path, positioning the JWT class
    in eat-in/lib may raise an issue with autoloading disabled
    - The solution is to create 'lib' directory in eat-in/app
    - eat/app is autoload in development and eagerloaded in production

Define the JsonWebToken class
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/a63dddae4476f0462ee1a04c9f591d4b84721379
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/8/files

Add custom errors handlers JWT errors
    - Defining the custom errors as sub-classes of StandardError
    enables us to rescue_from the custom errors once the errors are raised
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/3aeb17d9f7c8ccb54fff536e3f3e53c63a032e5f
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/8/files

Create an authorization service class
    - This authorizes requests to assert a valid token and user payload is included.
    - app/auth directory houses the auth service
    mkdir app/auth
    touch app/auth/authorize_api_request.rb
    mkdir spec/auth
    touch spec/auth/authorize_api_request_spec.rb

Add specs for AuthorizeApiRequest
    - The auth service defines an entry method, call, that returns a valid user
    object and raises an error when invalid.
