rails version 5.0.1
ruby version 2.3.1

rails new eat-in --api -T
    --api = generate the skeletal files for an api
    -T = exclude Minitest the default testing framework

Add gem, rspec-rails to Gemfile in groups, :development and :test.
    group :development, :test do
    end

Add gem, factory_bot_rails, shoulda-matchers, faker and database_cleaner to the Gemfile in group :test
    group :test do
    end

~~~
# Try using gemsets later
# Setup gem installation directory and local ruby version
#     echo .gems > .rbenv-gemsets
#     rbenv local 2.3.1
~~~

Change sqlite definition in Gemfile from gem 'sqlite3' to gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.3.0'
    - This addresses the issue in sqlite3_adapter.rb in
    activerecord-5.0.7.2/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/

bundle install

Initialize the 'spec' directory
    rails generate rspec:install

Create the directory where we define facotries for the Models
    mkdir spec/factories

Create a repository on GitHub

Push code to GitHub
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add skeletal files"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:alex-magana/eat-in.git
    git push -u origin master

Configure should-matchers and factory_bot_rails

Generate Restaurant model
    rails g model Restaurant name:string opening_time:string closing_time:string created_by:string
    - This generates a migration file in db/migrate/, a model in app/models/ and a spec file in rspec/spec/models
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/2/files    

Generate Item model
    rails g model Item name:string price:decima{10,2} available:boolean restaurant:references
    - `restaurant:references` creates an association between the Restaurant and Item models.
        - it add a foreign key, restaurant_id, in table Item.
        - it adds a `belongs_to` associaton to the Item model
    - use 'price:decimal{10,2}' or 'price:decimal{10-2}' for zsh
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/2/files

Run the migrations
    rails db:migrate

Generate Restaurants controller
    rails g controller Restaurants

Generate Items controller
    rails g controller Items

Add request spec files
    mkdir spec/requests && touch spec/requests/{restaurants_spec.rb,items_spec.rb}
    - Request specs are used for APIs because they are designed to emulate the
    behaviour across the full stack including, routing (provide by Rails).
    - Request specs can hit the actual endpoints in lieu of the controller
    specs which call the controller methods directly.

Add factories
    touch spec/factories/{restaurants.rb,items.rb}

Define Restaurant factory

    mkdir spec/support && touch spec/support/request_spec_helper.rb
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/e390895b23828107f59c91ed91f7e6a1e07e2688
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/5/files

Add routes in config/routes.rb
    - The routes are nested to enforce the 1:m association at the route level.
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/2a692677a5ac2d6580d0ffcf9ebf022fad5f5746

Define json_response helper
    - controller helpers go in the app/controllers/concerns directory
    - it returns a json response with the appropriate status code
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/commit/3eda84695333c7071c5e9f2f3f9b78df403d8218
    https://github.com/alex-magana/eat-in/pull/5/files

    - this is used to handle
    ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound which is raised by Model.find(:id), and,
    ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid which is raised by Model.create!
